    <p>About Me</p>
    <p>I have recenlty completed high school and I am very much looking forward to
    delve deeper into the programming world. I took this class in order to equip myself
    with the necessary tools like learning Javascript which will go a long way in terms of
    preparing myself to this amazing programming world. Other than that, I enjoy socializing
    with people and having a good time with by others.Evidently, one of my current interests
    is coding.</p>
